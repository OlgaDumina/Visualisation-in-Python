# Visualisation in Python
The aim of this project is to explore the potential and challenges of data visualisation, 
especially with tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. 
The focus is on creating effective visualisations that take into account 
both the characteristics of the data and human perception. 
The work covers all stages of data processing and analysis, starting with pre-processing, 
and focuses on the creation and evaluation of different types of visualisations 
in order to provide sound recommendations for the practical application of such methods.

In our study, we use homogenised data obtained from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) 
(https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data_v4_globe/). We limit our study to the territory of Ukraine.

It is recommended to carefully consider the design of the diagram, regardless of its type. For example, 
the use of colours should enhance the information and not distract from it, and the amount of data
in the diagram should be optimal to facilitate perception. Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly offer 
a wide range of tools to implement these principles, allowing you to tailor your visualisation 
to specific purposes and ensure effective perception of the information.
